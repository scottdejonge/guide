This is a standard paragraph, it makes up the majority of page content. Paragraphs should be short in length and use a tone that makes content easily discoverable. This can be achieved with text formatting such as super text along with sub text or using text styles to highlight content using **strong (or bold) text** or _emphasis (or italic) text_, or maybe underline text, as well as strikethrough text for redacted content.

> You can even include a quote which will break up content that surrounds it.

### A level 3 heading

Using headings to breakup content is the simplist and most effective way to draw the user's attention to each context within a page. It also helps break up content visually which makes larger content easier to read.

Sometimes content will need to be formatted in other ways including:

*   Unordered lists
*   with mutiple
*   list items.

As well as:

1.  Ordered lists
2.  with mutiple
3.  list items.

Text content can also have [links](#) which should be visually identifiable from other content either through contrast (colour) or using underlines.
